## A. Project Review

### Brief description of the project

The project focuses on the classification of trees using image recognition technology. It aims to identify and categorize different tree species based on images of their leaves, bark, or overall structure. By applying machine learning techniques, the system helps improve the accuracy and efficiency of tree identification for educational, environmental, and research purposes.

### Purpose of the image classification model

The image classification model is designed to detect and distinguish various herbal plants by analyzing their visual characteristics, including leaf patterns, structure, and color variations. Through the use of a trained image dataset, the system can recognize specific medicinal plant species efficiently. This helps simplify the process of plant identification, supporting learning, research, and proper documentation of herbal plants.
